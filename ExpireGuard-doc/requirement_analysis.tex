\section{Requirement Analysis}
This phase is crucial for developing a user-centered application. It involves understanding the users' needs, goals, and tasks to ensure that Expire Guard's design and functionalities align with their expectations and provide an optimal user experience.
\subsection{Competitor Analysis}
We have identified two main competitors that can be compared to Expire Guard. The first  is Google Calendar, a widely used application that allows users to create and manage events. Although it is not specifically designed to store and track document expiration dates, users can use it for this purpose by creating an event on the relevant date and time. Google Calendar's intuitive interface and integration with other Google services make it a versatile tool for managing schedules and reminders.\\
The second competitor is Evernote, a note-taking application that allows users to capture ideas, create to-do lists, and schedule memos. Evernote enables users to set alert triggers to notify them of their created memos, enhancing productivity and organization. While Evernote is primarily used for note-taking, its flexible tagging and search functionalities can be adapted for tracking document-related information, including expiration dates.\\
The following tables present a detailed comparison between Expire Guard and its competitors:\\

\end{table}
\noindent
Both comparisons demonstrate that our approach, focused on storing and tracking document expiration dates, is more effective in achieving the specific goal of notifying users about upcoming expirations based on their preferences. While Google Calendar and Evernote offer versatile functionalities, they cater to broader user needs beyond document expiration tracking. Our solution simplifies and enhances this process, making it more tailored and efficient compared to using Google Calendar or Evernote for this specific purpose.\\
\subsection{User Analysis}
The target users of this application are individuals with demanding jobs that require them to manage numerous document expiration dates, such as driver's licenses, legal documents, taxes, and more. The target profile is outlined as follows:
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XX}
		\textbf{AGE}& 18 - 50\\
		\textbf{GENDER}& Female/Male\\
		\textbf{REGION}& Europe Union\\
		\textbf{TECHNOLOGY}&Mobile applications/Smartphone\\
		\textbf{EDUCATION}& Any\\
	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}
\noindent
The next step is to define several personas and their corresponding scenarios. Personas are fictional characters created in user-centered design to embody the types of users who would have a genuine interest in using the application daily. They serve a pivotal role in uncovering insights about the audience, particularly representative of working professionals in the European Union.\\
Once personas are established, defining user scenarios becomes essential for a deeper understanding of each user's needs. These scenarios are narrative stories crafted to analyze how users would interact with and benefit from the application in various situations.\\
In the following subsection, three distinct personas will be presented, accompanied by a scenario for each. These scenarios are instrumental in advancing user analysis and informing the application's development process.\\
