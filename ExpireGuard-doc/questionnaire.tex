\section{Questionnaire}
To better understand the needs and goals of our audience, we conducted a questionnaire that reached out to 78 participants. Utilizing Google Forms, we efficiently gathered and analyzed responses to delve into the specifics of our application domain. The questionnaire was thoughtfully designed with carefully crafted questions divided into four main sections:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{General Questions:}
	These questions aimed to gather broad insights into participants' backgrounds, demographics, and general preferences that could influence their interaction with our application.
	
	\item \textbf{Questions about the Application:}
	This section focused on probing participants' expectations, desires, and specific requirements related to our application. It aimed to uncover their motivations for potentially using our product and what features or functionalities they prioritize.
	
	\item \textbf{Personal Questions:}
	These questions delved into participants' individual experiences, challenges, and personal insights relevant to our application domain. This section aimed to capture nuanced feedback that could provide a deeper context for understanding their needs and preferences.
	
\end{enumerate}
\\
By structuring our questionnaire in this manner and leveraging Google Forms for data collection and analysis, we aimed to gather comprehensive insights that will inform the development and refinement of our application. This approach ensures that we are aligning our product offerings closely with the expectations and requirements of our target audience, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.\\
