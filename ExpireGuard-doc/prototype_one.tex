\section{Prototype One}
As mentioned at the end of the previous sections, the improvements led us to develop Prototype One of Expire Guard. This time, we decided to create an interactive prototype of our design, as it will play a crucial role in the upcoming user-based evaluations. Below is the link to the interactive prototype, which can be viewed and explored to understand the differences from the mockups and see how it was enhanced based on the experts' suggestions:\\
